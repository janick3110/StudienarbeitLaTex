Data were provided by 267 men and 201 women ages 19 to 93. Consistent with earlier research and evaluations, there was no support for the view that the {MBTI} measures truly dichotomous preferences or qualitatively distinct types; instead, the instrument measures four relatively independent dimensions. The interpretation of the Judging-Perceiving index was also called into question. The data suggest that Jung's theory is either incorrect or inadequately operationalized by the {MBTI} and cannot provide a sound basis for interpreting it. However, correlational analyses showed that the four {MBTI} indices did measure aspects of four of the five major dimensions of normal personality. The five-factor model provides an alternative basis for interpreting {MBTI} findings within a broader, more commonly shared conceptual framework.},

Each dichotomous (two-sided) preference scale is discussed as to the aspect of learning style it measures, each having a unique importance in the relation of the {MBTI} to learning style. Each dichotomy's learning style characteristics are discussed, and an illustration is given as an example of how each type's learning style can be assessed. The {MBTI} measures not only personality type, but also each type's way of most effectively learning new material. The  benefits of such knowledge are numerous. (Contains 9 references.)

The findings indicate that while overall personality type is not related to learning strategy preference, three of the four indicators of personality type show a relationship to learning strategy preference.

	abstract = {The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ({MBTI}) was developed specifically to make possible the implementation of Carl Jung's theory of type and is concerned mainly with conscious elements of the personality. It assumes that to function well, an individual must have a well-developed system for perception and a well-developed system for making decisions or judgments. Four interacting preferences are used to generate each of sixteen types. In each type, one pole of each of the four preferences is preferred over the other, and through use becomes more highly developed. The four preferences are: Extroversion or Introversion, Sensing or Intuition, Thinking or Feeling, and Judgment or Perception. The types are described in detail and the concepts are illustrated with data from a sample of 3275  freshmen and transfer students who entered the University of Florida in September, 1972. An overview of research that has been conducted on the teaching-learning process with the {MBTI} is presented. Past data and present research indicate that the use of type as an organizing principle increases the power of prediction in educational research. ({RC})},

Hitherto, the possibility of research that monitors the preferred personality types according to the {MBTI} typology in these students has not been used. Therefore, we conducted a questionnaire survey (n = 180) and also asked a number of respondents to create a pictorial representation of the study field of recreology (n = 53). The results show that we can perceive certain differences from the general population, thus characterizing the specific features of students in the field of recreology. The most represented types among the respondents were {ENFP} (14.8\%) and {ENFJ} (14.5\%) out of a total of 16 possibilities. With regard to possible cognitive types, almost half of the sample belongs to the {NF} type, which is called “heuristic”. In comparison with other research studies, it is evident that the “systematic” {ST} type, which, on the contrary, is characteristic of professions such as engineers or accounting, is relatively less represented among students heading into the field of recreation and leisure services.},

Previous research suggests that adaptive e-learning systems can effectively address such individual differences and, consequently, they enable more directed tutoring via computer-assisted instruction. In this paper, we explore this assertion, reflecting on the outcomes of two successive experiments that were performed to empirically demonstrate that learners' personality traits might be significant in understanding differences in learning outcomes from using e-learning systems. One hundred and forty-five participants from Computer Science participated in this study. A two-by-two between-subjects factorial study was designed, where the personality traits derived from Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, and the two computer-based learning systems (adaptive vs. non-adaptive) are independent variables. The results suggested that the personality trait that could be indicative of preferred learning styles; in particular extraverted/introverted personal traits significantly influenced learning activity on adaptive e-learning system. A design guideline might be implicative of how the e-learning system suits the learner's personality trait.},

	abstract = {Learning style preference data were collected from 1,252 first-year chemistry students at the University of Sydney in 2004/05. Analysis of the preference score distributions strongly supports the adoption of a trait-based personality model, in line with modern five-factor model research, rather than older dichotomous type-­based models. Using this interpretive framework, significant and strong correlations have been found between dimension preference scores and academic performance in end-of-semester examinations. In general, students’ average examination performance improves as introvert personality characteristics increase, and a similar trend is observed as thinking (as opposed to feeling) characteristics become dominant. These findings have substantial implications for pedagogical practice, and raise equity issues relating to assessment.},

Therefore, the present study investigated the relationship between the Big Four model of personality types (or in other words, psychological types) and learning approaches among Chinese university students. The participants were 217 students from a university in China. Psychological types and learning approaches were assessed by surveys. The results showed that deep learning approach positively related to sensing-intuition and negatively related to extraversion-introversion and thinking-feeling. Surface learning approach positively related to judgement-perception. Psychological types accounted for approximately 11 percent of the variance in deep learning approach and around 10 percent of the variance in surface learning approach, after controlling for gender and year of study. Moreover, learning approaches were related to gender, year of study, and parents’ education levels. The influence of sociocultural contexts on students’ learning approaches and practical implications for education were discussed.},

The existence and nature of individual differences in the use of intuition were explored by studying relationships between the sensing–intuition scale of the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator and strategy and performance on an implicit learning task. Results indicated differences in strategy and performance in implicit learning between sensing and intuitive types. Intuitive types were more likely to report a strategy of using intuition; sensing types were more likely to use explicit knowledge. In addition, intuitive types were more accurate than sensing types in their intuition. Thus, the position that there are individual differences in the use of intuition has been supported.

	abstract = {It is vital for educators to teach learners in accordance with their aptitude, which can be useful to help learners reach their full potential. Educators have been taking the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ({MBTI}) as a powerful tool to understand the differences in students’ learning styles, adopting appropriate teaching strategies to accommodate the learning styles of different types of students can effectively prevent students from being tired of studying. It is a problem worthy of research to recognize the students’ personality traits with technological means. Therefore, we propose a method to recognize learners’ {MBTI} from videos, which can be applied in the course learning and practice stages of software engineering education. We propose a novel approach to recognize the {MBTI} personality traits of learners from videos. Personality and emotion unconsciously affect facial expression, the speaking style in social contexts. However, in the current literature, there is no publicly available source of images dataset labeled with the {MBTI} personality scale; nearly all the available data are text. In this paper, we use two datasets: images extracted from {ChaLearn} First Impressions dataset and the Myer-Briggs Personality Type Dataset from Kaggle for our training tasks. Furthermore, we take plentiful text data labeled with the {MBTI} personality scale as the source domain and image data as the target domain for borrowing knowledge from the source domain to facilitate the learning task in a target domain. By adopting feature transfer, a bridge is built between the source domain and the target domain. We perform experiments on the transfer task and evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, the results of this study can assist educators in regards to the identification of learners’ {MBTI} personality types in a new way.},

	abstract = {Computational thinking ({CT}) is a cognitive ability that is considered one of the core skills to be developed in order to successfully adapt to the future. Therefore, it is being included in school curricula all over the world and, gradually, at an earlier age. However, as the incorporation of {CT} learning in schools is recent, there is still no consensus on its exact definition or on how it should be assessed. Recent research suggests that systems of assessments should be used for this purpose, using various instruments, and thus covering the different {CT} dimensions. However, there is a lack of validated instruments
	for the assessment of {CT}, particularly for early ages. Taking as a reference a three-dimensional {CT} framework, based on a validated {CT} test, and aimed at early ages (five- to ten-year-old students), the Beginners Computational Thinking Test has been developed as a tool to be used within a system of assessments. This instrument has been designed, submitted to a content validation process through an expert judgement procedure, and administered to primary school students, obtaining very favourable results in terms of its reliability.},

	abstract = {We present a theory of the causes of difficulty in children’s creation of informal programs. Ten-year-old children are able to devise such programs to rearrange the order of the cars in trains on a simple railway track with a single siding. According to the theory, they rely on kinematic mental models that simulate the required sequence of steps, and we devised a computer program, {mAbducer}, which does so too in creating its own programs for such rearrangements. An experiment showed that a simple measure of the complexity of its programs, based on Kolmogorov complexity, predicts ten-year-olds’ difficulty in this task: the measure is the number of words in {mAbducer}’s programs for solving the rearrangement in a minimal number of moves. Complexity, in turn, reflects the structure of the required programs, which need loops of moves to be repeated, and often moves before and after such a loop. Children’s errors are predictable in both their location and nature. Our results therefore have implications for the assessment and pedagogy of computational thinking.},

	This paper introduces an experimental, controlled comparison study of three learning designs, involving a problem based learning ({PBL}) approach in connection with the use of {LEGO} Mindstorms to improve students programming skills and motivation for learning in an introductory programming course. The paper reports the results related with one of the components of the study - the experiential qualities of the three learning designs. The data were collected through a questionnaire survey with 229 students from three groups exposed to different learning designs and through six qualitative walk-alongs collecting data from these groups by informal interviews and observations. Findings from the three studies were discussed in three focus group interviews with 10 students from the three experimental groups.

	abstract = {Owing to their ease of engagement and motivational nature, especially for younger age groups, games have been omnipresent in education since earliest times. More recently, computer video games have become widely used, particularly in secondary and tertiary education, to impart core knowledge in some subject areas and as an aid to attracting and retaining students. Academics have proposed a number of approaches, using games-based learning ({GBL}), to impart theoretical and applied knowledge, especially in the computer science discipline. Our research is concerned with the design of an innovative educational game framework focused on the development of Computational Thinking ({CT}) skills, and herein we introduce a serious game, based on our framework, which encourages the development of {CT} skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. We describe how a limited number of key introductory computer programming concepts have been mapped onto the game-play, and how an equivalent set of skills characterising {CT} can be acquired through playing the game. A survey response group of 25 students, following computer science and related degree programmes but with very diverse backgrounds and experience, provided initial usability feedback on the game. Their feedback confirmed that they found the game enjoyable, and also universally believed that this approach would be beneficial in helping students learn problem-solving skills for introductory computer programming. Feedback from this group will be incorporated in a revised version of the game, which will now be subject to rigorous experimental evaluation and analysis, to provide structured empirical evidence in support of our approach.

	doi = {10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.04.224},
	abstract = {A number of researchers have documented several difficulties faced by learners of basic programming concepts. Among the suggested pedagogical solutions to overcome these difficulties is the use of serious games inthe learning process. In fact, these games are more likely to boost the motivation of students and allow them to develop their knowledge efficiently. Our studyfocuses on evaluating such usage and the resulting students’ motivation towards programming. We’ve made students create simple games using the Scratch game environment in order for them to learn programming basics. The experiment was conducted with a group of 69 high school science major students. This group of students was arbitrarily chosen and divided into three sub-groups. With the first sub-groupwe experimented with our pedagogical method based on the creation of simple games using Scratch environment. With the other sub-groups we used a conventional method based on Pascal programming language. Twosurveys were distributed at the beginning and at the end of the experimentation in order to identify the programming level of students, their gaming habits, their motivation and interest for programming in the future. The analysis of the surveysshows that using an environment for learning programming such as Scratch highly motivate students and empower them to pursue their studies in programming. In fact, when learners were asked about their desire to continue their studies in programming, 65\% of students who have experienced with Scratch environment consider continuing their studies in programming whereas only 10.3\% of students who used a standard programming environment showed some interest.},

By combining a modular computer programming language with a modular building platform, {LEGO} Education has allowed students (of all ages) to become active leaders in their own education as they build everything from animals for a robotic zoo to robots that play children's games. Most importantly, it allows all students to develop different solutions to the same problem to provide a learning community. We look first at how the recent developments in the learning sciences can help in promoting student learning in robotics. We then share four case studies of successful college-level implementations that build on these developments.},

Several authors have proposed the use of visual programming environments and robots to overcome the difficulties of this course, some of which have been successful. This paper presents the two-year experiment using Lego Robots carried out at the University of the Basque Country ({UPV}/{EHU}) with around 100 students, along with the results. Satisfactory results have been obtained regarding both motivation and the perception of the students of their learning process; moreover the drop-out rate decreased even though no statistical significance was obtained regarding the final marks of the course. From those results and the analysis of the data it was derived that robot sessions should be more integrated in the curriculum, giving them greater relevance in the final marks. In addition, it is indispensable to classify course students and adapt learning sessions to each student type due to the high student heterogeneity.},

The article explores the varied possibilities and application of learning technologies in terms of organizational learning perspectives. Design/methodology/approach Given this is a relatively new field of practice and research, the three organizational learning theoretical perspectives – behavioural, action and practice – form a base upon which we can conceptualise learning as mediated through {iOLTs} and how we can leverage these technologies, particularly for practice-based organizational learning, which focuses more on the intangibles of learning. Findings Due to the pervasive and ubiquitous potential of organizational learning technologies, new avenues for analysing the mediating effect of technologies on learning enable our research and practice attention to shift from formal learning to the informal; from top-down learning management to bottom-up learning creation; from cognitive and behavioural approaches to social, spontaneous and contextual learning – helping us decipher the “language” of learning in concrete ways. Originality/value The {iOLTs} are emerging and at an ever-increasing pace. Practice-based {iOLTs} can help trace and decipher the “language” of learning in concrete ways, which is a key aspect in our being able to leverage our organizational learning capacities.},

	abstract = {Personalization has been widely used in Web-based instruction ({WBI}). To deliver effective personalization, there is a need to understand different preferences of each student. Cognitive style has been identified as one of the most pertinent factors that affect students' learning preferences. Therefore, it is essential to investigate how learners with different cognitive styles interact with {WBI} programs. This paper presents an empirical study, which examines the effects of cognitive styles on students' learning patterns and the effects of learning patterns on their learning performances. Riding's cognitive style analysis was used to identify the students' cognitive styles. Data mining, especially a clustering technique, was used to analyze the results. It was found that field independent students frequently used an alphabetical index whereas field dependent students often chose a hierarchical map. Such learning patterns also have great effects on their performance, especially for field dependent students.},

Among various individual differences, cognitive styles particularly affect student learning because they refer to individuals’ information processing habits. In this vein, this study aimed to compare the effects of desktop computers ({DCs}) and {MDs} on student learning from a cognitive style perspective. The results demonstrated that students in the {MD} scenario showed more positive reactions than those in the {DC} scenario. Students in the {MD} scenario generally performed better than those in the {DC} scenario. In addition, Holists and Serialists performed differently in the {DC} scenario, while they demonstrated similar performance in the {MD} scenario. However, they spent a similar amount of time for completing the tasks, regardless of the {DC} scenario and {MD} scenario.},

	abstract = {Scratch is a "media-rich programming environment" recently developed by {MIT}'s Media Lab that "lets you create your own animations, games, and interactive art." Although Scratch is intended to "enhance the development of technological fluency [among youths] at after-school centers in economically disadvantaged communities," we find rarkable potential in this programming environment for higher education as well.We propose Scratch as a first language for first-time programmers in introductory courses, for majors and non-majors alike. Scratch allows students to program with a mouse: programmatic constructs are represented as puzzle pieces that only fit together if "syntactically" appropriate. We argue that this environment allows students not only to master programmatic constructs before syntax but also to focus on probls of logic before syntax. We view Scratch as a gateway to languages like Java.To validate our proposal, we recently deployed Scratch for the first time in higher education via harvard Summer School's Computer Science S-1: Great Ideas in Computer Science, the summertime version of a course at harvard College. Our goal was not to improve scores but instead to improve first-time programmers' experiences. We ultimately transitioned to Java, but we first introduced programming itself via Scratch. We present in this paper the results of our trial.We find that, not only did Scratch excite students at a critical time (i.e.,, their first foray into computer science), it also familiarized the inexperienced among th with fundamentals of programming without the distraction of syntax. Moreover, when asked via surveys at term's end to reflect on how their initial experience with Scratch affected their subsequent experience with Java, most students (76\%) felt that Scratch was a positive influence, particularly those without prior background. Those students (16\%) who felt that Scratch was not an influence, positive or negative, all had prior programming experience.},

	abstract = {Simulation games are now increasingly applied to many subject domains as they allow students to engage in discovery processes, and may facilitate a flow learning experience. However, the relationship between learning experiences and problem solving strategies in simulation games still remains unclear in the literature. This study, thus, analyzed the feedback and problem solving behaviors of 117 students in a simulation game, designed to assist them to learn computational problem solving. It was found that students when learning computational problem solving with the game were more likely to perceive a flow learning experience than in traditional lectures. The students’ intrinsic motivation was also enhanced when they learned with the simulation game. In particular, the results of the study found a close association between the students’ learning experience states and their problem solving strategies. The students who perceived a flow experience state frequently applied trial-and-error, learning-by-example, and analytical reasoning strategies to learn the computational problem solving skills. However, a certain portion of students who experienced states of boredom and anxiety did not demonstrate in-depth problem solving strategies. For instance, the students who felt anxious in the simulation game did not apply the learning-by-example strategy as frequently as those in the flow state. In addition, the students who felt bored in the simulation game only learned to solve the problem at a superficial level.},

(We do not cover research relating specifically to other programming styles.) The main focus of the review is on novice programming and topics relating to novice teaching and learning. Various problems experienced by novices are identified, including issues relating to basic program design, to algorithmic complexity in certain language features, to the “fragility” of novice knowledge, and so on. We summarise this material and suggest some practical implications for teachers. We suggest that a key issue that emerges is the distinction between effective and ineffective novices. What characterises effective novices? Is it possible to identify the specific deficits of ineffective novices and help them to become effective learners of programming?},
